# Design Patterns in Java


### Motivation
* To cover standard GOF design patterns in greater depth

### Notes
* This repository is organized by broad design pattern types > specific design patterns
* I have not used TDD through this course and have ignored standard encapsulation practices in some cases
* These practices should not be emulated, but shortcuts were taken in some areas to focus more heavily on the design patterns themselves
